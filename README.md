Programming using R to find the useful information in 2 data-sets:
-Using Supervised and unsupervised analyzes
-Using ACP Methods, the penalty methods: Cp, BIC, AIC, Adj R2, compression methods: lasso ridge to find the subsets.
-For classification: LDA, QDA, KNN, Random Tree, Logistique Regression etc.
-For regression: Linear Regression methods etc
-Statistical learning, cross validation, neural networks etc.
