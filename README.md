# Machine-learning-Projets

Apply machine learning algorithms in data sets:
Programming with R
-Using Supervised and unsupervised analyzes

-Using ACP Methods, the penalty methods: Cp, BIC, AIC, Adj R2, compression methods: lasso ridge to find the subsets.

-For classification: LDA, QDA, KNN, Random Tree, Logistique Regression etc.

-For regression: Linear Regression methods etc

-Statistical learning, cross validation, neural networks etc.
